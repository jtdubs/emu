TODO:
- Better command-line invocation
- Better error handling (less panics)
- Lower overhead method for controlling frequency...


Optimizations:
- Allow periphs to push interrupts to CPU rather than polling each cycle
- Get rid of RefCell's by changing from a digraph to a tree.  Needs "clocked attachment" concept.  Maybe.
- Cycle returns interrupt bool


Timing history:
- Initial speed: 3.8MHz
- Switch from Mutex to RefCell: 8.8MHz
- Amortize timing measurements: 200MHz
- Misc tiny tweaks: 225MHz
